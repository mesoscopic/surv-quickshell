This is my personal [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org) configuration.
As a result it is tailored entirely for my use and is intended more as a basic example than for distribution.

The configuration assumes the use of [Hyprland](https://hypr.land) and [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/).

## Features
- Hyprland workspace display
- Volume, brightness, and battery display with dynamic icons
- Active window title
- System tray
    - considering adding keyboard interaction
- Time display
- Fuzzy .desktop launcher (triggered by `qs ipc call menu toggle`)
    - considering adding more launcher features
- **Very** simplistic notification display (click notifications to dismiss)
    - considering adding keyboard interaction

May consider including the currently-separate wallpaper layer if it ends up integrating with the rest of the shell.
